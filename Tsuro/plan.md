# Plan

##Part 1
An automated player need core pieces for reading input from a local game or server game, a decision making process, and sending it back as a move.

The auto player needs a component to interpret a game response and evaluate a board state with all player pieces on it. The component should also expect the response to have the auto playerâ€™s own hand, information on the deck pile and discard pile to base their decision on.

Another component will use the received info and evaluate possible options for a move that keeps them in the game and then determine the best one.

Finally a component will take that decisio and construct a message for the local game or server game that tells the game what their tile placement will be and how it will be rotated.
