# Task 2

1. The other team followed our specification to the letter. They used our instructions as the comment headers on each funciton, all of the signatures were exactly what we asked for, and overall they gave us exactly what we wanted. There was no attempt to deviate from our design, which since our design seems to work fine, is a good thing. The only mark against them is that there were a few missteps in the actual implementation. Several times they removed the wrong index of an object from an array and for the return methods they returned the actual object and not a copy.

2. Because of how close the other group was to our specification, it should be trivially easy to connect the client from Task 3 and this server. Having not actually connected it, we do not know the 'actual', but an estimate, allowing for bugs to crop up, would be less than an hour.

3. The specification we provided seemed to give the exact right information given that they did everything we asked and implemented it just as we would have if we had been coding it ourselves. The only differences being the minor bugs (which we imagine were just a minor mistake). The specification seemed to be explicit enough to get what we needed.
